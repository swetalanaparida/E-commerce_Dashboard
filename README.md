# E-commerce_Dashboard
Objective: The owner of Madhav Store has tasked us with creating a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India.

Built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to track and analyze online sales data, including sales, profits, orders, customer details, payment modes, and geographic distribution across cities and states. The dashboard features filters and slicers for drill-down analysis, user-driven insights, and custom data connections, joins, and calculated fields. Visualizations include stacked bar charts, donut charts, stacked column charts, cards, and slicers to offer comprehensive insights into the business performance.
